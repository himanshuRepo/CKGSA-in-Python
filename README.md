# CKGSA-in-Python
Python Code for Chaotic Kbest Gravitational Search Algorithm (CKGSA)

This is the 'Chaotic Kbest Gravitational Search Algorithm (CKGSA)' for minimizing Sphere benchmark function. This code refers to paper: "H. Mittal,R. Pal,A. Kulhari,and M. Saraswat, “Chaotic Kbest gravitational search algorithm (CKGSA)”, In Contemporary Computing (IC3), 2016 Ninth International Conference on, pp. 1-6, IEEE".

Change 'test_functions.m' and 'test_functions_range.m' for your own applications.

The code template used is similar to code given at link: https://github.com/himanshuRepo/GSA_PythonCode and matlab version of GSA at mathworks.
